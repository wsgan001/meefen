## Notes

This book chapter systematically introduces Chi's theory about conceptual change. She thinks misconceptions and conceptual change happen on three grain sizes: false beliefs, flawed mental models, and ontological miscatogerization. Therefore, instructions to promote conceptual change should also be conducted on those three levels.
