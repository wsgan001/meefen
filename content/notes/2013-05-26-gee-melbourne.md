## Notes

the exciting combination of consumption and creation

  * all video games are rule systems about shapes, movements, and combinations.
  * but what would happen if I gave each shape, movement, and combination of shapes in Tetris a meaning?
  * story elements: actors, actions; states, events
  * grammar

games as literacy
  * what's the role of story in games?
  * Casovilia: story doesn't matter.
  * The primary thing here is the player's production of story elements, not a story per se (like Alucard kills a Sword Lord). But the little events you're doing. A set of acts, and a set of meanings not enough to create a deep story.
  * Video games allows players to have all kinds of choices, but designers cannot prepare every possible choices beforehand. So what makes video games playable is the players make meanings..
  * "video games cannot be art." -someone
  * Gee disagrees.
  * The marriage of rules and story elements allows two quite different stories to exist: the Designer's story, and the virtual-real story (player's trajectory through the game).
  * the second one is more important.
  * everyone go through the game differently. the example of killing a lord in a game: different trajectory.
  * the example of WoW when players going back to a place, they thought about before. a personal history. building meanings when playing. personal trajectory. doesn't happen in reading books. so players' story, own projection of their story important, not the designer of the games.
  * the possiblity of creating a world in which each person's trajectory is important; each person is different, each person lay down a deap past of his own that can be compared or contrasted with everyone else.


Cognitive approaches in games
  * modern psychology: emotional component in thinking
  * give information emotional charge --> better stored and learning more deeply; emotional attachment
  * the problem of schooling
  * games can trigger emotions.

who is playing the game?
  * virtual and real characters. melding of computer character and person.
  * psychology: people feels go as far as body goes.
  * in games, control is part of deep pleasure.
  * virtual and real have their own skills.


Professional experience
  * army game
  * you command soldiers to do things
  * the characters know a lot of things. but you need to make the right command.
  * solders
  * i (player) can start from zero knowledge, to build my professional knowledge by playing. because they know a lot.
  * by the time of getting good at it, i contribute more.
  * constrains.
  * soldiers <-militery experience --> player
  * share professional expereince
  * start before competence

the good model of helping people develop professional knowledge. but only used in training people to kill.
not killing people, but things like urben planning

Three stories:
1. the designer's story
2. the virtual-real story
3. the virtual-real career story

giving children a career trajectory, of problem solving (love that!!)

Summary
  * triaval grammar
  * going deeper
  * give story of your own learning

  * the example of Civilization players as gods
  * kids designing games designer of other people's learning; meta-knowledge

what's the grammar of KB?



  * complex vocuabulary after Grade 4
  * adopt before 5
