## Notes

Marlene recommended it to me, to inform me of my thinking on epistemological issues in KB and promisingness.

The idea of belief-mode vs. design-mode epistemology is interesting. (This thesis integrates Marlene's analysis of Kuhn and Perry research, clarifying that it represents a belief-mode epistemology.)

The thesis studies development of epistemological beliefs of graduate students in online courses. Epistemological beliefs were analyzed using: surveys, interviews, (reflective) learning logs, and KF note posts. Knowledge Forum log data (like note reading, writing, revising) are used to enrich the analysis.

However, belief-mode epistemology is simply conceived as showing signs of caring for idea improvement. I believe work on this frontier can be further advanced.
