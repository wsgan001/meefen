## Notes

Literature review
  * the simplest form of conceptual change: enrichment--accumulation on the level of specific theory
  * revision: reorganization of knowledge on the level of the framework theory---so more difficult and need specific instruction
  * problem: students are not aware the contradiction, so tend to enrich rather than revise them.
  * Learners acquired lot of facts and added new explanations to the representations they already had, but were not able to apply them in solving problems
  * Presenting a cognitive conﬂict does notseem to be enough for promoting conceptual change (Caravita & Hallden, 1994, p. 95; Limon & Carretero, 1997, p. 218).


Textbook--what type of text could promote conceptual change in relation to scientiﬁc topics

  Wang and Andre (1991):“conceptual change text”
    * to elicit students’ common misconceptions
    * to activate the students’ existing schemata
    * provide information countering the misconceptions
    * however, a traditional expository text; hard to distinguish whether the diagrams cause the gains
  Guzzetti et al. (1992): find a type of text which has been proved to foster conceptual change
    * a refutational text which attempted to create a cognitive conﬂict and explain why the naive conception is incorrect seemed to be more effective


the difference with younger and older students
young students---lack of metaconceptual awareness, then conflict and discomfort will not lead to revision of the framework theory


mental model---the very criterion of text comprehension
connecting prior knowledge and text information


recognition of the differences between naive and scientiﬁc representations---an important prerequisite for conceptual change
this study: text characteristics which stimulate metaconceptual awareness---an even more crucial factor
text design: a refutational text


Design


The main differences in the two versions of text are as follows:
(a) macro-level organisation: start from energy---all creatures need energy to live, and plants can make energy by themselves; water as an energy
(b) textual units inducing metaconceptual awareness.
points out the difference between possible misconceptions of the learner and the scientiﬁc thinking concerning photosynthesis
keep the reader on the right path to construct an adequate mental model
there are seven metaconceptual text elements
* this sentence is interesting. i wonder whether there is any other way to keep students on the "right" path


Pretest-posttest questions
(1) Retention questions (2) Inferential text comprehension questions (3) Critical distinction questions (4) Generative questions


Results
treatment effect on (3) Critical distinction questions and (4) Generative questions
but not on (1) and (2)


leave some research questions to be investigatedhow long lasting and stable are the conceptual changes generated? the interaction between levels of text comprehension and conceptual change is an interesting question for future studies
the effect of text design on conceptual change could also be related to the text comprehension process
the role of pictures
