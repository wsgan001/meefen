> [*Open Scholarship*](http://www.openscholarship.org/jcms/c_6160/en/open-scholarship) "encompasses open access, open data, open educational resources, and all other forms of openness in the scholarly and research environment, [and] is changing how knowledge is created and shared." -- [Association of Research Libraries](http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/open-scholarship#.V9IhqZMrLwc)

Below are my current efforts of being / becoming an open scholar:

- **Open Access**. My research articles or preprints are accessible on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bodong_Chen). My presentation slides are on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/bodong), while older ones are on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/dirkchen).
- **Open Educational Resources**. My course materials are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/meefen?tab=repositories), which currently include courses on [learning analytics](https://github.com/meefen/la-spring16), [social network analysis](https://github.com/meefen/sna-edu), [foundations of technology in education and business](https://github.com/meefen/ci5301), and [tech and ethics in society](https://github.com/meefen/CI4311W). Materials of workshops I organized are also mostly on Github: [LASI '18 Tutorial on Social Media Mining](https://github.com/meefen/lasi18-smm), [LAK 16 temporality](http://lak16time.github.io/), [knowledge building analytics](http://bodong.ch/kba-symp/#!index.md), [data visualization with R](http://rpubs.com/bodong/data-vis-with-r), etc.
- **Open Participation**. I [tweet](https://twitter.com/b0dong), and sometimes [annotate the Web](https://hypothes.is/stream?q=user:bchen).
- **Open Source**. I try to open-source my R code on Github, for [Lag-sequential Analysis](https://github.com/meefen/LagSeq), building [lexical frequency profile](https://github.com/meefen/LexFreq), [Twitter analytics 1](https://github.com/meefen/twitter-hashtag-analytics) and [2](https://github.com/meefen/twitterytics-shiny), [making CORDTRA diagrams](https://github.com/meefen/CORDTRA-R), etc. My research projects' source codes will be shared under the [CoLIG Github organization](https://github.com/colig). 
- **Open Scholarly Workflow**. Open Scholarship does not only involve the "outputs," but also the "process." I frequently post my **annotated bibliography** [here](/categories/notes/). To get my *raw* highlights and *rough* notes to this format, I use: 1) [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) and [MetaPDF](https://www.metapdf.com/) for *reading & annotating*; 2) some [R scripts](https://github.com/meefen/rBibNotes) I wrote for *text transformation*; and 3) [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for *text rendering* on the Web.
