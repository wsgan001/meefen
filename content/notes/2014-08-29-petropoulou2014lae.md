## Notes

The short paper introduces Learning Analytics Enriched Rubric (LAe-R), an assessment plugin in Moodle. One unique thing about this tool is it allows the teacher to create rubrics by themselves and map aspects of learning with specific activities in Moodle. Empower teachers to make this judgment based on their professionism is a great idea.

## Highlights


STATE OF THE ART OF MOODLE RELATED LEARNING ANALYTICS TOOLS (p. 2)

1. GISMO is a visualization tool for Moodle, which uses log data, process them and finally produces graphical representations that can be used by teachers so as to examine social, cognitive and/or behavioral student interactions. (p. 2)

2. MOCLog is a sum of tools that are used for the analysis and presentation of log data within Moodle. (p. 2)

3. Excel Pivot Tables is a tool that can be used for the production of learning statistics coming from Moodle. Moodle itself exports its data from the log files in spreadsheet form (Excel), through which the user can feed in data and create Pivot Tables. (p. 2)

The Learning Analytics Enriched Rubric (LAe-R) tool was created as a Moodle plug-in (version 2.2+). It is being integrated as an advanced grading method of Moodle. (p. 2)

4. Analytics and Recommendations is installed within Moodle as a supplement block and can be used both by (p. 2)

teachers and students. It is a tool for the visualization of students' involvement in each activity of an online course as well as a consultation tool, which can recommend activities to students so that they can improve their attainment. (p. 2)

USING LAe-R

when creating an ER, a teacher can add (p. 2)

types of criteria that are associated to learning and interaction analysis indicators such as collaboration, grades to assignments, study of learning resources. (p. 3)
