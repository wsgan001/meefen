## Notes

*Summarize*: One interesting approach used in this paper is key word network based on co-occurrence.

*Assess*: However, the extraction of dominant keywords did not offer significant insights in the discourse. The discussion mentioned that influential pieces in MOOCs exist in non-academic spaces like blogs, highlighting a tension among different spaces for scholarly communication.

*Reflect*: NA

## Highlights

This study analyzes the impact of the MOOC movement in the form of scientific article during the birth and explosion period (2010-2013) in two of the most relevant databases: Journal Citation Reports (WoS) and Scopus (Scimago). We present, through a descriptive and quantitative methodology, the most significant bibliometric data according to citation index and database impact. Furthermore, with the use of a methodology based on social network analysis (SNA), an analysis of the article’s keyword co-occurrence is presented through graphs to determine the fields of study and research. The results show that both the number of articles published and the citations received in both databases present a medium-low signi- ficant impact, and the conceptual network of relationships in the abstracts and keywords does not reflect the current analysis developed in general educational media.

3.1. Objectives The research aims were twofold: • To quantify from a bibliometric approach the MOOC scientific production in the form of articles in (p. 3)

JCR and Scopus databases during the period 2010- 2013, according to the following variables: total num- ber of published papers; number of received citations; major citable journals; average citations per year; name, country, and institutional affiliation of the most cited authors; and articles’ methodological approach. • Analyze the key words used in articles to esta- blish the thematic and conceptual implications to bet- ter understand the MOOC movement.

The use of databases from a comparative perspective is a research method used in measu- ring the impact of a term or trend and is usually referenced to three international databases: JCR, Scopus, and Google Scholar (Jacso, 2005; Levine-Clark & Gil, 2009), (p. 4)

ubse - quently, we turned to the analysis of keywords fre- quency (Bhattacharya & al., 2003; Ding, Chowd hury & Foo, 2001) with special attention to the analysis of co-occurrence within the specific research domain of MOOCs. (p. 4)

Initially, the search equation «mooc» or «MOOC» or «massive open online course» was used in both JCR and Scopus databases. With the initial informa- tion from both databases, a total of 63 publications in JCR and 180 in Scopus were retrieved, and they were finally reduced to 48 and 111, respectively, by removing books, books chapters, repeated records, irrelevant publications, conference proceedings, and documents that did not fit the purpose of the study or were out of the 2010-2013 interval. (p. 4)

Table 6 presents the impact of the most cited aut- hors in the two databases, (p. 4)

Table 7 (http://goo.gl/4Tm3vs) shows the most active countries during this early period of the move- ment. (p. 5)

we conducted an analysis of the relations established between keywords through a graph representation. We then chose the words «Abstract» and «Keywords» as the basis for obtaining the word network once the article has been uploaded to the archive, and for the development of binary count, we considered a minimum of two items: (p. 5)

• Of a total of 530 terms extracted from Web of Science, the program determined that only 67 terms meet this criterion. • Of a total of 1,715 terms extracted from Scopus, the program determined that only 323 terms meet this criterion. (p. 5)

The networks presented in Figures 2 and 3 are the graphical representation of the matrix of relations among keywords in JCR and Scopus, respectively. (p. 5)

In JCR, Figure 2 shows the central position of concepts in the network (p. 5)

a higher node degree focus on the following items: «educational resource», «open- ness», «assessment» and «impact». (p. 6)

In Scopus network (Figure 3), the results of the betweenness degree are significant 27,248 (p. 6)

recurrent in the published articles: «education», «learning», «experience», «environment» and «design». The results of degree of closeness indicate that, in these five major nodes, those aspects that serve to interrelate the domi- nant categories in the publication of articles indexed in Scopus. (p. 6)

Analysis by networks of abstract and keywords shows that MOOC’s relations are being linked thema- tically with the educational experience of learning, environment, design, and evaluation. These relations are not in direct line with the current main criticism that focuses on the pedagogical principles of connecti- vism, monetization, accreditation, and technological architecture of platforms and resources embedded in them (Hill, 2012; Daniel 2012, Vázquez-Cano, López-Meneses & Sarasola, 2013). (p. 7)

Finally, some of the biggest names in MOOC research, such as George Siemens, Stephen Downes, and Sir John Daniel, have not published in both data- bases and develop their reflections in lower impact journals and in their own Web pages, blogs, specific newspapers, social networks, and so on. (p. 7)
