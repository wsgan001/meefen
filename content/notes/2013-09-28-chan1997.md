## Abstract

This study examined how individuals and peers process scientific information that contradicts what they believe and assessed the contribution of this activity to conceptual change. Participants included 54 students in Grade 9 and 54 students in Grade 12, who were randomly assigned to four conditions: (a) individual conflict, (b) peer conflict, (c) individual assimilation, and (d) peer assimilation. Depending on the condition, students were asked to think aloud or discuss with their peers eight scientifically valid statements, which were presented in an order that either maximized or minimized the conflict between new information and existing beliefs. Pretest and posttest measures of prior knowledge and conceptual change were obtained, and student verbalizations were tape-recorded and coded for five levels of knowledge-processing activity. Two major approaches were identified from this analysis: direct assimilation, which involved fitting new information with what was already known, and knowledge building which involved treating new information as something problematic that needed to be explained. A path analysis indicated that the level of knowledge-processing activity exerted a direct effect on conceptual change and that this activity mediated the effect of conflict. Knowledge building as a mediator of conflict in conceptual change helps to explicate previous equivocal research findings and highlights the importance of students' constructive activity in learning.

A major research  theme in instructionalpsychology emphasizes students'self-regulatory  strategyin their  own learning  (Bereiter  & Scardamalia,  1992; Glaser& Bassok, 1989; Resnick,  1989).  Theoretical  notions  such as surface-deep  (Biggs,1984), mindfulness  (Salomon & Globerson,  1987), explanation  (Bielaczyc  et al.,1995),  and intentional  learning  (Bereiter  & Scardamalia,  1989) have been used tocharacterize  the distinction  between a passive  versus  an active  approach  to learni (p. 3)

tion is particularly  interestingin the context  of conceptual  change. Research inreading (Scardamalia  & Bereiter,  1984), writing  (Scardamalia  & Bereiter,  1987),and intentional  learning  (Bereiter  & Scardamalia,  1989; Chan, Burtis,  Scardamalia,& Bereiter,  1992) has shown the importance  of a problem-centered  approach tolearning.  Two contrasting  approaches  to understanding  new conceptsin unfamiliardomains have been identified:  Direct  assimilation  involves  fitting  new informationdirectly  into existing  knowledge,  whereas knowledge building  involves  learnerstreating  new conceptsas something  problematic  that they need to explain  (Bereiter& Scardamalia, (p. 4)

knowledge-building  approach would seem beneficial  for the learning  of difficultconcepts.  Instead  of directly  assimilating  new concepts,  students  employing  knowl(p. 4)

The goal of this study was to examine how students  construct  scientific  under-standingwhen confronted  with information  that contradicts  what they believ (p. 5)

The second objective  was to assess  the efficacy  of conflictual  information  andto examine its relations  with a knowledge-building  approach  to learni (p. 5)

the first  objective  was to identify  the kinds of knowledge-processingactivity  students  engagein when they are learning  from scientific  information  andto assess  the effects  of such activity  on conceptual  change (p. 5)

edge-building  activity  are more likely  to delay immediate  interpretation,  to recog-nize the difficulties  of the new concepts,  and to avoid equating  ontologicallyincompatible  new concepts  with their  prior conception (p. 5)

A third objectivewas to investigate  the role of peer interaction  inconceptualchange by examining  how pairs of students  learn from incompatible  informati (p. 6)

Three research  questions  were addressed:  (a) Do the hypothesized  approaches  ofdirect  assimilation  and knowledge building  differentially  affect  conceptual  change?(b) Does conflict  lead to more conceptual  change, and are its effects  mediated byknowledge-processing  activity?  and (c) Does peer collaboration  foster  conceptualchange when students  are confronted  with contradictory  informati (p. 6)

DISCUSSION (p. 27)

Surface  Versus  Deep Feature (p. 28)

l:  A path analysis  showed thatknowledge-processing  activity,  as defined  by the scale,  exerted  a direct  effect  onconceptual  change and mediated  the effects  of confli (p. 28)

These findings  are consistent  with the well-established  idea that experts  repre-sent problems at a deep level,  whereas novices  attend  only to the surface  features(Chi, Feltovich,  & Glaser,  1981) (p. 29)

Piecemeal  Editing  Versus  Delayed  Interpretatio (p. 29)

Even though theyhad very inadequate  knowledge of thedomain, they were trying  to move in the direction  of formulating  problems at adeeper leve (p. 29)

Knowl-edge-building  responses,  however, suggested  students'  concerns with a deeperproblem:the principle  of evolution  representedin the text and how it fits  with theirprior belie (p. 29)

ly,  knowledge-building  responses  reflected  an active  stance  inidentifyingconflict  and attempts  to reconcile  the discrepancies.  Students  employing a knowl-edge-building  approach  do not avoid conflict  but use the contradictory  statementsas opportunities  for upgrading  their  domain understand (p. 30)

fs.  The more expert  learners,  however,  recognized  that something  was differ-ent; hence, they were able to subject  their  knowledge to inquiry.  Just as theory-evi-dence coordination  isimportantin scientificexperimentation  (Klahr & Dunbar,1988; Kuhn, 1989), a problem-solving  process is required  for identifying  andresolving  the discrepancy  between new information  and domain understandi (p. 30)

The importance  ofexplanationin science  learning  has been well documented (Bielaczyc  et al.,  1995;Chi, de Leeuw, et al., 1994 (p. 30)

In contrast  to usinga problem-minimization  approach,  the more expert  learners  attend  to deep princi-ples,  construct  coherence  from discordant  information,  seek out knowledge con(p. 30)

s,  students  employinga knowledge-building  approach may benefit  more com-pared with those who provide  a one-shot  explanation  to eliminate  discrepant  factsthat do not fit their beliefs.  In viewing new information  as problematic  and asrequiring  explanations,  students  are engagedin an ongoing process of problemrecognition  and conflict  resolution.  Even ifthey have constructed  inaccurateexplanations,  they are more likely  to detect  anomalies  in upcoming information  andto revise  their  models continua (p. 30)

Patching  Versus  Explanation-Based  Inquiry (p. 30)

Theory-Evidence  Conflation  Versus  Problem  Recognit (p. 30)

Indeed,  focusing  on the multiplicityof relations  among pieces of information  (Brown & Day, 1983) and emphasizingcoherence  (Scardamalia  & Bereiter,  1984) are crucial  to meaning construct (p. 30)

A distinction  needs to be made between external  and internal  conflict:  Often,contradictory  information  is presented  in the hope that it will produce cognitiveconflict.  These results  seem to show that,  without knowledge-building  activity,confrontation  may not produce cognitive  conflict  but only assimilation  or externalcompetiti (p. 33)

Collaborative  Processing  of Contradictory  Informat (p. 33)

. The path analysis  suggests  that conflict  may triggerknowledge-building  activity,  which then leads to conceptual  change, but thatconflict  in the absence of knowledge building  will not produce conceptual  change (p. 33)

Conflict  in itself  is not enough; it needs to be mediated by students'  knowledge-building  activity.  Viewing learning  as problematic  minimizes assimilation  an (p. 36)
