## Notes

Two approaches: in vitro and in vivo.

This chapter focuses on in vivo study.

Mechanisms underlying conceptual change:
  1. (how scientists treat) inconsistent results
  2. analogy, esp. local and reginal analogies
  3.fruitful analogies call for different sources of knowledge of lab members
  4. more expertise --> more analogies
  5. social interactions that promote conceptual change (need to check coding scheme they use)
  6. (no) serendity
  7. risk--may connect with promisingness. (need to check how scientists rate risk levels)
