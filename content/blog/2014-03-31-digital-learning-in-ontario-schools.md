Supported by a Mitacs fellowship, I have been working with a
Toronto-based non-profit organization, [People for
Education (P4E)](http://www.peopleforeducation.ca/), to investigate
digital learning in Ontario public schools since October 2013.

Today, a report about digital learning in Ontario schools has been
officially [released](http://www.peopleforeducation.ca/pfe-news/7427/).
Although there have been studies of digital learning in the Canadian
context, this topic has not been system-wise inspected. This report
draws on a rich set of data coming from P4E's annual principal
questionnaire participated by 28% of Ontario public schools, as well as
student demographics and questionnaire data from Ontario's Education
Quality and Accountability Office ([EQAO](http://www.eqao.com/)). The
main findings included in this report are the following:

-   Students begin interacting with computers at school from the
    earliest grades, and access to the internet at school is all but
    universal.
-   There is potentially a digital divide, linked with student family
    incomes and remoteness of schools. 
-   The use of learning technologies continues to vary considerably
    among teachers. More recent learning technology innovations are
    experimented depending on teacher's own comfort levels.
-   The use of free, online resources is becoming popular. 
-   E-learning credit courses developed by the Ministry are not widely
    used. Students in smaller schools are more likely to earn credits
    through e-learning, as are students in the southwest and northern
    regions.
