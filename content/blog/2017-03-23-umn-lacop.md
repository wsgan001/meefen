Today, we kicked off our [Learning Analytics Community of Practice at UMN](https://cei.umn.edu/courses-programs/learning-analytics-community-practice) (#UMNLACoP)! Launching this CoP has been a joint effort among the [Center for Educational Innovation](https://cei.umn.edu/), the [College of Liberal Arts](https://cla.umn.edu/), the [Libraries](https://www.lib.umn.edu), and the [College of Education and Human Development](https://cehd.umn.edu).

During today's kick-off event, I spent 15 minutes presenting a quick introduction to the field of Learning Analytics. Below is an audio recording of my presentation.
