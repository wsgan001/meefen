As a member of the Outreach Advisory Board of the [Journal of the Learning Sciences (JLS)](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/hlns20), I was really glad to see the journal putting together a web annotation event during December 11-22, 2017. This activity is yet another move made by the editorial team to engage its readership on various social media venues.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Coming Soon: Web annotation of JLS articles in Hypothes.is.<br>The first article is a study by Akkerman and Bruining published in 2016 in Volume 25 (2).Read the full article at <a href="https://t.co/tGoOiQKLUR">https://t.co/tGoOiQKLUR</a>  and visit <a href="https://t.co/2dYOBe15L8">https://t.co/2dYOBe15L8</a>  for instructions for using <a href="https://twitter.com/hypothes_is?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hypothes_is</a> <a href="https://t.co/z5oSHleIKB">pic.twitter.com/z5oSHleIKB</a></p>&mdash; JrnlLearningSciences (@JLearnSciences) <a href="https://twitter.com/JLearnSciences/status/937719563390672896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2017</a></blockquote>

During this web annotation event, participants are invited to annotate a recently published open-access article, [*Multilevel Boundary Crossing in a Professional Development School Partnership*](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1147448), using an open web annotation tool named [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/). Hats off to the authors for their support of this event.

The editorial team has put together **detailed instructions** in this [Google presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cmoz22xEY8QjHBiYC-H2oU0YHJSTLCBhWelbusSXbKM/edit#slide=id.g2b48df0836_0_10).

During and after the event, in addition to the Hypothes.is sidebar, a participant can either use [Hypothes.is' advanced search functionality](https://hypothes.is/search?q=url%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.tandfonline.com%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F10508406.2016.1147448) or [an aggregation tool](http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html?facet=uri&mode=documents&search=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1147448) to **review existing annotations** made on this article.

I am excited for this move JLS is making, not only because **scholarship could be more networked and discursive**, but also because I see great opportunities of using web annotation to bridge learning spaces in classrooms. To me, making an annotation is forming a relationship with an idea. As educators, **we ought to think deeply and design smartly to value such relationships as students are traversing various treks of life**. See [our ongoing NSF project](https://cligr.github.io/projects/discow.html) for details.
