The [MOOC Research Conference](http://www.moocresearch.com/mooc-conference/program) has
just taken place at University of Texas, Arlington, December 5-6, 2013.
I was fortunate to be on board of one research project -- *"Hatch,
Match, and Dispatch: Examining the relationship between student intent,
expectations, behaviours and outcomes in six Coursera MOOCs at the
University of Toronto"* -- which was among the 20+
[MRI](http://www.moocresearch.com/research-initiative/about) projects
participating in this MOOC Research Conference. [Chris
Teplovs](https://twitter.com/cteplovs), [Stian
Håklev](https://twitter.com/houshuang) and Laurie Harrison from our team
attended the conference in person, and they were surprised by an
[*Icepocalyse*](http://dallas.eater.com/archives/2013/12/06/icepocalypse-happened-but-these-restaurants-are-open.php)
in that area. Some people said it might be because too many Canadians
were present at the conference (which is quite convincing :-P).

Although I was not able to attend the conference, I had a lot of fun
following its
"[backchannel](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23mri13)" on
Twitter. The discussion took off one day before the conference (there
were pre-conference workshops) and climbed to its peak during the first
day, featured by the [Jim
Groom](https://twitter.com/jimgroom)'s keynote. The backchannel produced
a total of 1894 tweets, with 394 contributors.

Here, I am pulling together a list of top URLs (up until now) shared in this
discussion, just to highlight a few things I think that might be
interesting to think of. This is by no means to say there links
represent the key messages of the conference, but by reviewing them we
may get a glimpse of main issues discussed during the conference. These
top links are organized into a few themes below.

**6. Voices saying that “MOOCs kinda suck”**

[To MOOC or not to
MOOC?](http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/12/04/to-mooc-or-not-to-mooc/)-
a blog post by Jonathan Rees [11 hits]

-   As a history professor from Colorado State University and a guy who
    thinks “MOOCs kinda suck”, Rees said, "*Yet it turns out that when
    you put a bunch of MOOC enthusiasts in a conference together,
    whatever orthodoxy that exists isn’t really all that far from
    mine... That said, what does set me apart from the rest of this
    conference I think is a difference in priorities. Most of the
    conversations were about the pitfalls of producing MOOCs. I wanted
    to talk more about how universities that may use other schools’
    MOOCs might consume them. Most of the people here are from
    disciplines outside of the humanities, so I tried to explain that
    what works in math or CS will not necessarily work for history,
    especially history survey classes. While everyone seemed interested
    in improving pedagogy, there was a kind of disturbing assumption
    underlying all my discussions that any class that doesn’t use
    technology is somehow broken by definition.*"

[What problem do MOOCs
solve? ](http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/what-problem-do-moocs-solve/)-
another blog post by Jonathan Rees [7 hits]

-   Rees contended that, "*MOOCs threaten this kind of learning
    [afforded by a very interactive and personalized teaching he has
    been doing]. Yes, I know that we professors are supposed to use
    MOOCs to flip our classrooms so that we can spend more time doing
    exactly what I’m describing, but what will other students do all
    class period when I’m providing personalized learning? When will
    they have time to do the reading I assign if they’re watching all
    those videos for homework? And, most importantly, how can I be sure
    that my administration won’t just fire me and force students to fend
    through a lot of taped lectures all by themselves?*"
-   He also described his view about how MOOCs should work: "*In an
    ideal world, MOOCs would supplement modern higher education rather
    than replace it. We do not live in an ideal world. I’m not
    suggesting that people with better motives stop innovating. What I
    am suggesting is that they cannot innovate in a bubble. There is a
    political economy of MOOCs that matters just as much as their
    technological structure, especially for those of us who will never
    teach in or learn from a MOOC over the course of their academic
    careers.*"

MOOCs and learning analytics

**1. Certifying the Hard Stuff (and the role of learning analytics), by
[Simon Buckingham Shum](https://twitter.com/sbskmi) [9 hits]**

**2. Group Discussion Summaries during the conference - [Google
Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lVN_WaQQ3ME3AgwJFUfrz8ME2hMNJlU2TyQS_a18dY8/edit)  [8
hits]**

-   Besides Simon's post, this file contains links to breakout group
    discussion around learning analytics in MOOCs, which was identified
    as one of the key challenges to be addressed. This file also
    contains links to discussion summaries of the other two
    challenges: *Organizational challenges to MOOC development and
    delivery*; and *Systemic challenges with MOOCs: competency-based
    learning, credit & credentialing*. (It's pretty neat to have such a
    file, although some notes may not make sense to you.)
-   I'm personally glad to see people from the learning analytics
    community present in the discussion.

Hatch, Match and Dispatch
-------------------------

Finally, our group's presentation about [*Hatch, Match and
Dispatch*](http://www.slideshare.net/cteplovs/hatch-match-and-dispatch-mri13-presentation)
was also among the list of top links (7 hits). Like other projects, our
work shared at the conference was still in progress. And I am really
excited about our next steps to move this research project forward.
