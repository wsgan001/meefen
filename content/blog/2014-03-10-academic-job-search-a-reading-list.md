When a friend requested me to share some tips on academic job search, I
realized it was the time to reflect on this unique journey of myself, or
at least to organize a reading list that has inspired my own search. So
here we go, a **personal**, and **possibly biased**, reading list about
academic job search. Enjoy!

do not forget to seek advice from friends and colleagues around you.
Academic job search should never be a solo sport!
